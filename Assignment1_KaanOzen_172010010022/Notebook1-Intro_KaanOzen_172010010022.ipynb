    "Python is a programming language used to \"give instructions\" to a computer to produce the desired actions or output. Like many other programming languages, such as Ruby, PHP, C++, and Java, Python is high-level programming language, which makes it easy to learn and use Python. Python is an object oriented programming language. The variables of a Python program are objects that represent data (e.g. a number, a character or an entire csv file) along with functions (methods) that can be applied to the data. As a point in case, we can represent a matrix (rectangular array of numbers) using an object of type (or class) ndarray (which is included in the Python library numpy). Each ndarray object contains methods for processing the matrix entries such as summing them (see documentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are plenty of resources for learning basic Python, and we recommend you to utilize these if you are new to Python or programming in general. Here, you can find a comprehensive list of books and courses for beginners. For example, the books \"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python\" by Al Sweigart and \"Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist\" by Allen B. Downey are freely available online and are excellent places to start. You do not need to read the whole book, as the chapters about data types, indexing, loops, and functions will provide sufficient knowledge for this course. If you prefer more interactive learning, you can find short tutorials and Python exercises.\n",

    "A Jupyter notebook is a document that contains Python code blocks along with the output (text or plots) generated by the code. Moreover, a Python notebook also contains text blocks that allow to provide explanations and discussions of the Python code blocks and the corresponding outputs. Jupyter notebooks are typically edited and executed via a web application that consists of an online browser as the user interface (where you edit and execute the notebook) and a JupyterHub notebook server that runs the Python code blocks and returns the results to the web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter notebook server is not necessarily running on a remote computer but can also be installed on your own local computer. Thus, you can run notebooks locally on your computer, with properly installed Python and Jupyter notebook server. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, a notebook consists of different types of blocks or \"cells\". The two most important types of cells are \"markdown\" cells for natural text and code cells that contain exectuable Python code (notebooks can also be used with other programming languages).

    "The Python library `numpy` provides implementations of many matrix operations as well as other useful features, such as random number generators. Many functions of this library are based on the data type \"numpy array\". A numpy array is an object that stores $N$-dimensional arrays of numbers, where $N$ is the number of dimensions. The shape of a numpy array is given by a sequence of $N$ integers that indicate the number of \"elements\" in each dimension. Maybe the most important special case of numpy arrays is when $N=1$, corresponding to **vectors**, or when $N=2$ for **matrices**. A matrix with $5$ rows and $2$ columns is represented by a numpy array of shape $(5,2)$. \n",
