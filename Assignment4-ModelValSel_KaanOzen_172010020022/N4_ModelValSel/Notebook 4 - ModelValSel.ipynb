    "When applying machine learning to prediction problems, our main objective is to find a model that can accurately predict the label of data points for which it is yet unknown. To this end, we want to estimate a model's predictive capability on data points that have not been used for training the model. This is also frequently referred to as the **generalization capability** of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous rounds, we established that ML models learn by searching for the predictor in the hypothesis space that minimizes the average loss on a set of **training data**. Also, we considered how to calculate the **training error** of a ML model, i.e., the error of the model on the training data. \n",

    "Unfortunately, the training error is a poor proxy for what we wish to measure - the predictive performance on a new and unlabeled data. Based on this observation, we are faced with two questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How can we better estimate the performance of a trained model on a  new and unlabeled data? Such estimates are needed to assess whether a ML model is suitable for practical use and to select the best model for deployment out of many alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Is it possible to alter a ML model to learn a predictor function with good generalization capabilities? This is in contrast to learning the function that minimizes the average training loss/error.\n",

Later, we will look at **regularization** techniques that enable ML models to learn predictor functions with better generalization capabilities by minimizing a penalized average loss during training."

    "What is model validation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Model validation is the process of evaluating the predictive capability of a ML model on new data points. By using good model validation techniques, we can estimate the performance of a ML model with a reasonable confidence prior to its use in practice. Before we dive into the details of model validation, we will briefly consider **overfitting** in order to show why model validation is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we want to predict a label $y$ of data points based on their features $\\mathbf{x}$. In order to do this, we choose a ML model and train it on a set of labelled data by minimizing the average loss of its predictions. A naive approach we might then take to estimate the performance of the trained model is to calculate its training error, which we assume to be equivalent to the average loss. Unfortunately, this approach is highly problematic and leads to overly optimistic estimates of the model's predictive capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training error is a poor estimate of a model's predictive performance because it is calculated on the same dataset that was used to train the model. Since this dataset only represents a small sample of all available data points, it is likely that a predictor that minimizes the average loss on the training set happens to fit this dataset particularly well. Consequently, the average loss on the training set will, in general, overestimate the performance of the model. This phenomenon is referred to as **overfitting**, because the trained model fits the training set overly well.\n",
    "\n",
    "While some degree of overfitting is typically present when applying a ML model to a prediction problem, it is a particularly significant issue when applying ML models with large hypothesis spaces that contain complex predictor functions (in relation to the size of the dataset). In such cases, a model that seemingly fits the data very well might turn out to perform very poorly on data points not in the training set. This type of situation is exemplified in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"N4_ModelValSel/overfitting.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure visualizes a dataset containing $m=20$ data points, along with two different predictor functions that were obtained by training two ML models on the four data points indicated by the orange crosses. The green predictor belongs to a standard linear regression model, while the red predictor belongs to a more complex, 4th degree polynomial model. The key observation regarding the predictors is that while the more complex model fits the data used for training very well, it has a much poorer fit on the rest of the data than the simpler linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the figure above seems like an extreme example due to miniscule number of data points in the training set, it nonetheless makes an important point. If we do not have the capacity to validate a model's performance on data points outside the training set, we will likely  overestimate the predictive capability of complex models due to overfitting. This sets us up for a great let-down when applying the models in practice. Furthermore, we will end up selecting overly complex models over simpler ones when choosing between many candidate models. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a final note, it is worth emphasizing that the optimal complexity of the predictor function is generally dependent on the dataset's size. A deep neural network might generalize well when trained on a huge dataset, whereas even a linear model using many features might be prone to severe overfitting on a small dataset."

    "The simplest scheme for validating the predictive performance of a ML model is to train the model on only some of the available labelled data, and use the rest to validate the performance of the trained model. Typically, the dataset used for training is referred to as the **training set**, and the data used for validation is referred to as the **validation set**. The image below visualizes a dataset split into a training and validation set.\n",

    "Let us repeat the scheme above in slightly more detail. Assume that we have a dataset $\\mathbb{X}$ at our disposal, and that we wish to train a ML model that can predict the label $y$ of data points based on their features $\\mathbf{x}$. To be able to later validate the performance of the model, we will first split the dataset $\\mathbb{X}$ into a training set denoted by $\\mathbb{X}^{(t)}$ and a validation set denoted by $\\mathbb{X}^{(v)}$. The recommended size of the validation set is somewhat context dependent, but a common choice is 20-30% of the entire dataset.\n",

    "We revisit the fictional scenario considered in Notebook 3, in which you are an intern at a real estate fund and have been assigned a task of developing a ML model for predicting an apartment price of different neighborhoods. The following excerpt serves to refresh your memory on the problem formulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"*The staff in your group have built a dataset containing features of 20 different neighborhoods. These features include the average number of rooms in the apartments, the percentage of buildings constructed before 1970 in the neighborhood, as well as eight experimental features designed by your colleagues in research. In addition, the fund's domain experts have valued a representative sample of apartments in each of the 20 neighborhoods and have arrived at a reliable estimate for the median apartment price in each one. This valuation has cost the fund a fortune, but the investment will pay off if your ML model can use this information to accurately predict the median apartment value of other neighborhoods at a negligible cost.*\n",

The data points in this problem are the different neighborhoods, and the label of these is the median apartment price. The features of the neighborhoods were already explicitly referred to in the previous paragraph. Still, it might be worth repeating that the features are properties belonging specifically to the data points.*\"\n"

    "As we already discussed, it is not a good idea to use the training error to assess the performance of the optimal predictor since this predictor was found by minimizing the average loss on the training set. \n",

However, this does not necessarily lead to better performance on new data. A complex model with too many features (large $r$) might only fit the training data very well, and generalize poorly to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the case of $r=m_{\\rm train}$, i.e., the number of features is the same as the number of labeled data points in the training set. Under very mild conditions it can be shown that in this case there always exists a linear predictor $h(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{w}^{T} \\mathbf{x}$ such that $y^{(i)} = h(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)})$, i.e., the training error is exactly zero! \n",

In practice, this often results in the model learning a predictor with some zero-valued regression weights since smaller weights are not penalized less than larger ones.

The training and validation errors are to be calculated using 5-fold cross-validation. To this end, you will use an extremely useful class in Scikit-learn: [GridSeachCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) \n",

It also takes other optional parameters, such as the number of data splits `cv` in cross-validation.\n",

Furthermore, you must define the parameters `scoring='neg_mean_squared_error'`, `cv=5`, and `return_train_score=True`. Here, `scoring` defines the metric with which training and validation errors are calculated, `cv` the number of splits in the $K$-fold cross-validation, and `return_train_score` whether or not training errors are calculated.\n",

The results are stored in a dict, and the training and validation scores are accessed with the keys `mean_train_score` and `mean_test_score`. `GridSearchCV` uses negative MSE instead of MSE for implementational reasons, so you must remember to turn the errors positive when defining `err_train` and `err_val`.\n",
