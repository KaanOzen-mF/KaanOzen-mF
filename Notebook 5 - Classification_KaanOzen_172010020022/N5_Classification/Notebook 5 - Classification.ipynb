    "In this round, you will learn how to formulate and solve a **classification problem**. Recall that **regression problems** are machine learning problems that involve data points with a numeric label such as the grayscale level of a pixel. In contrast, **classification problems** arise from data points whose labels have only a finite number of different values. The most simple classification problem is a **binary classification problem** where the label can take on only two distinct values such as $y=0$ vs. $y=1$. For example, $y$=\"picture includes a pedestrian crossing\" vs. $y$=\"picture does not include pedestrian crossing\". The label $y$ of a data point indicates to which class (or category) the data point belongs. \n",
    "\n",
    "We consider two widely used methods for solving classification problems: **logistic regression** and **decision trees**. These two methods differ in the choice of hypothesis space, i.e., the set of predictor functions $h(\\mathbf{x})$ that map the features $\\mathbf{x}$ of a data point to a predicted label $\\hat{y}=h(\\mathbf{x})$, which is hopefully a good approximation of the true label $y$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We mainly consider binary classification problems with data points having labels from a set of size two such as $\\{0,1\\}$ or {\"image shows a crossing\", \"image shows no crossing\"}. However, we will also discuss a simple approach to upgrade any binary classification method to solve classification problems with more than two label values such as {\"image shows one crossing\", \"image shows more than one crossing\", \"image shows no crossing\"}. We refer to classification problems with more than two label values (or categories) as **multi-class classification problems**. "

    "<img src=\"N5_Classification/CrossingDetection.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The city planners of Helsinki are regularly sending small airplanes to take high-resolution aerial photographs of different city areas. These aerial photographs are available via the open data service at https://kartta.hel.fi. It is important to monitor the condition of pedestrian crossings to determine if a renewal is necessary. To this end, we want to find those areas which contain a pedestrian crossing. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will learn how to use classification methods to determine if a particular area contains a pedestrian (zebra) crossing or not. We model this pedestrian crossing detection as a machine learning problem. The problem amounts to learn a predictor (or classifier) map $h(\\mathbf{x})$ which delivers a predicted label $\\hat{y} = h(\\mathbf{x})$ which indicates if a certain area contains a pedestrian crossing or not. The classification is based on numeric features $\\mathbf{x}=\\big(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}\\big)^{T}$ that are computed from an aerial photograph of the area in question.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will solve this binary classification problem using two different classification methods: logistic regression and decision trees. These two methods differ in the choice of hypothesis space. Decision tree classifiers use a flow-chart representation of the predictor function. In contrast, logistic regression uses the hypothesis space of linear predictor functions, which is also used in linear regression (see Notebook 3 - Regression). \n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between logistic and linear regression is the set of label values: the real numbers for linear regression and a set of size two {0,1} for logistic regression. Another difference between linear and logistic regression is the loss function. While linear regression is based on minimizing the squared error loss, logistic regression minimizes the logistic loss function, which is presented later. \n",

    "As you might already know, most machine learning problems (and methods) consist of three components: \n",
    "\n",
    "* some **data** (a bunch of data points, each of which is characterized by features and labels) \n",
    "* a **hypothesis space** (consisting of a set of predictor functions from features to labels)\n",
    "* a **loss function** which is used to assess the quality of a particular predictor function \n",

    "ML methods aim at finding a good predictor map (or classifier) $h(\\mathbf{x})$, which takes some features $\\mathbf{x}$ as input and outputs an estimate for the label $y$ of the data point (which represents an area). To measure the quality of a particular predictor $h(\\mathbf{x})$, we apply it on data points for which we know the true label values $y$. The basic principle of classification methods is to find (or learn) the best predictor function out of a set of computationally feasible functions (the hypothesis space). \n",
    "\n",
    "We have access to a data set consisting of $m=178$ data points $\\big(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)},y^{(i)}\\big)$ for $i=1,\\ldots,m$. Each data point represents a particular city area, and is characterized by several features $\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}=\\big(x^{(i)}_{1},\\ldots,x^{(i)}_{n}\\big)^{T}$ that are computed from an aerial photograph of that area. Each data point is also characterized by a label $y^{(i)}$ which has been found out by a city planner who manually inspected the areal photograph. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the labeled data to find a good predictor $h(\\mathbf{x})$. In contrast to regression problems, where the ouput $h(\\mathbf{x})$ of a predictor map is a (real) number, the predicted label $h(\\mathbf{x})$ in a classification problem is a discrete value representing a particular class of data points. In this case it is customary to use the term **classifier** for the predictor $h(\\mathbf{x})$.\n",

With simplicity in mind, we present the theory of  logistic regression in the case of a **binary** classification problem, in which the label only takes on values 0 or 1. Later in the notebook, we will consider extending the binary model to multiclass classification via a **one-versus-rest** scheme.\n",

Instead, we assume that the features $\\mathbf{x}$ are related to the probabilities of the data point having the different labels. The fundamental assumption of (binary) logistic regression is that the log-odds of a data point $\\mathbf{x}$ having label $y=1$ are linearly related to the features of the data point:\n",

    "\n",
    "When fitting a classification model, the goal is to find the parametrization of the model that results in the best predictions on the training set on average, as measured by some **loss function**. In classification problems we wish to maximize the **accuracy** of the classifier - the fraction of correctly predicted labels out of all data points. A seemingly natural choice of loss function in this case is the 0-1 loss, which incurs a loss of 1 if the prediction does not match the true label of a data point and 0 otherwise. This is due to the fact that minimizing the average 0-1 loss on the training set is equivalent to maximizing the accuracy. However, the average 0-1 loss cannot be minimized efficiently and is thus unusable in many applications. Most classification models consequently use some alternative loss function to optimize the classifier with respect to the model parameters.\n",

Recall that the value $\\mathbf{w}^{T} \\mathbf{x}$ gives the estimated log-odds of the true label $y$ being equal to $1$. Thus, large positive values of $\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}$ represent a high degree of confidence in that $y=1$ and large negative values a high degree of confidence in that $y=0$.\n",

    "Standardizing data for logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "When the features $\\mathbf{x}_1,\\mathbf{x}_2,\\ldots,\\mathbf{x}_n$ of the dataset are of very different scales, the iterative optimization algorithms used for training the logistic regression model (and many other models) are often slow to find the optimal parameters, or at times, might even fail to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to avoid these issues, it is common practice to **standardize** the dataset before using it to train the model. The feature matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ is standardized feature-wise - that is, for all elements in each column, we subtract the column mean and divide by the standard deviation ($\\sigma$) of the column to obtain the standard score:\n",

    "\n",
    "The result of this transformation is that the mean of each feature is 0, and the new values of the feature represent the deviation from the feature mean as measured by the number of standard deviations (+/-). Standardization can be performed in Scikit-learn in multiple ways, but the `StandardScaler` class is often convenient in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    " Standardization and model validation\n",

On the other hand, if $|w_0 + \\mathbf{w}_{\\rm opt}^{T} \\mathbf{x}| \\approx 0$, then the data point with features $\\mathbf{x}$ is close to the decision boundary, i.e., it is a border case which cannot be classified reliably.\n"

A decision tree is a flowchart-like representation of a predictor function $h(\\mathbf{x})$ that reads in the features $\\mathbf{x}$ of a data point and outputs a predicted label $\\hat{y}=h(\\mathbf{x})$. The decision tree consists of **nodes**, which represent certain tests, e.g., \"is the first feature $x_{1}$ larger than 10?\". The nodes are connected by **branches** that correspond to the result or outcome of a test (there is one outgoing branch for each possible answer of a test node). By following the branches, we end up at a leaf node (which has no further branches). Each leaf node is associated with a certain output value $h(\\mathbf{x})$. The picture below depicts a decision tree for wine classification with test nodes colored blue and leaf nodes colored orange and green. \n",

The basic idea is the same as in linear or logistic regression, we try out many different decision trees (using different choices of test nodes) and pick the one which results in the smallest average loss incurred on some labeled training data points $(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)},y^{(i)})$. However, in contrast to logistic regression, this learning or optimization problem involves searching over a discrete set of different configurations of test nodes instead of a continuous convex optimization of the model parameters. This makes training decision trees computationally more challenging than logistic regression that allows using efficient convex optimization methods (such as gradient-based methods). However, clever approaches to learning good decision trees with a reasonable amount of computational resources have been developed, although details of these are outside the scope of this course. \n",
